## Dashboard Stats

Your dashboard shows four key metrics at a glance:

- **Total Balance**: Combined balance across all your wallets

## Wallet Groups

Wallet groups are collections of wallets used for bundling tokens and generating volume. You can create multiple groups to organize your operations.

### Creating a Wallet Group

Click the **"Create Group"** button to get started. You have two options:

#### Option 1: Generate Wallets

Generate fresh wallets automatically. Perfect for clean starts with no previous transaction history.
