- **Generate Ascii**: Create AI-generated ASCII art for a unique look
- **Google Image**: Search and use images from Google

Enter a search term and select an image from the results. This is perfect for quick meme token launches.

#### Cropping Your Image

After uploading or selecting an image, you can crop it to fit perfectly.

![Crop Token](/images/deploy-crop-token.png)

Adjust the zoom and position, then click **Apply Crop** to finalize.

### Token Metadata

Fill in your token's basic information:

- **Name**: Your token's full name (e.g., "South Park Sucks")
- **Ticker**: The token symbol (e.g., "SPSN") - use the shuffle button for random suggestions
- **Description** (optional): Brief description of your token (0-500 characters)

### Vamp Token

Copy metadata from an existing token instantly.

Click **Vamp Token**, paste a contract address, and we'll automatically fetch and populate the token's name, ticker, description, and image.

### Advanced Metadata (Optional)

Add social links to your token's metadata:

- **Website**: Your project's website URL
- **Twitter**: Your Twitter/X handle or URL
- **Telegram**: Your Telegram group or channel URL

## Launch Configuration

### Launch Platform

Choose where to deploy your token:

- **PumpFun**: Most popular Solana token launchpad
- **Bonk**: Alternative launch platform

### Contract Address (CA)

Choose how your token's contract address is generated:

- **Vanity**: Generate an address ending with your platform tag (e.g., ends with "pump")
- **Random**: Completely random contract address
- **Custom**: Use a custom private key to control the contract address

## Launch Modes

### Standard Launch

Deploy a token using only your master wallet as the developer.

![Standard Launch](/images/deploy-standard-launch.png)

Perfect for simple launches without bundling. Your active master wallet will be used as the developer wallet for this launch.

<Note>
You can switch between multiple master wallets or add new ones. Learn more in the [Master Wallets](/master-wallets) guide.
</Note>

### Bundled Launch

Deploy with multiple wallets for instant distribution and volume.

There are three modes: safe, instant, and delayed.

#### Wallet Group Selection

Choose a wallet group or auto-create one on deployment.

![Select Wallet Group](/images/deploy-select-wallet-group.png)

**Options:**
- **Auto-create group on deploy** (Recommended): Automatically creates a new wallet group when deploying
- **Select existing group**: Choose from your wallet groups and pick a dev wallet

#### Sniper Wallets

Configure how many wallets from your group will participate in the bundled launch (0 to max group size).

Use the slider to select how many wallets should snipe the token at launch.

#### Insta-Sell

Automatically sell tokens after purchase to create initial volume and trading activity.

![Insta-Sell](/images/deploy-instasell.png)

- **Enable Insta-Sell**: Toggle on to activate
- **Delay**: Set delay in milliseconds (0ms for instant, up to 1000ms)
  - 0ms = instant sell
  - Higher values = delayed sell

The wallets will sell immediately after launch, creating organic-looking trading activity.

<Note>
Insta-sell creates realistic trading patterns by having wallets buy and immediately sell tokens.
</Note>

#### Multi-Launch

Launch the same token multiple times with different dev wallets, combining with insta-sell for maximum effect.

![Multi-Launch](/images/deploy-multi-launch.png)

- **Enable Multi-Launch**: Toggle on to activate
- **Launch Count**: Number of separate launches (1-4)

Each launch uses a different dev wallet, making it appear as multiple people are launching similar tokens.

<Warning>
Multi-launch is an advanced feature. Make sure you understand how it works before using it.
</Warning>

### Developer Buy Range

Set a randomized buy amount for the developer wallet on each launch.

![Developer Buy Range](/images/deploy-dev-buy-range.png)

- **Min**: Minimum SOL to buy (e.g., 0.1 SOL)
- **Max**: Maximum SOL to buy (e.g., 1 SOL)

Each launch will randomly buy between the min and max amounts, making it look more organic.

## Quick Launch Configs

Save your deployment settings as presets for instant reuse. Perfect for repeating the same strategy across multiple token launches.

### Creating a Quick Launch Config

Click **Add Config** in the Quick Launch section to create a new preset.

![Quick Launch Config](/images/quick-launch-config.png)

Configure your preset:
- **Config Name**: Name for this configuration (e.g., "quick 0.5 SOL")
- **Dev Buy Amount**: Default SOL amount to buy on launch
- **Enable Insta-Sell**: Toggle on to enable automatic selling after purchase
- **Enable Multi-Launch**: Toggle on to launch multiple times in parallel

#### With Advanced Options

When you enable Insta-Sell and Multi-Launch, additional options appear:

![Quick Launch Enabled](/images/quick-launch-enabled.png)

- **Insta-Sell Delay (ms)**: Delay before selling after deployment (0 for instant)
- **Launch Count (1-4)**: Number of parallel launches
- **Developer Buy Range (SOL)**: Randomized buy amount between min and max

Click **Create Config** to save your preset.

### Using Saved Configs

Your saved configs appear in the Quick Launch section for instant deployment.

![Quick Launch View](/images/quick-launch-view.png)

Each config shows:
- Config name
- Dev buy amount
- Configured delay (if using insta-sell)

**Using configs:**
- **Click a config** to instantly apply those settings to your current deployment
- **Star a config** to activate it for quick deployment from your Twitter feed

### Quick Launch from Twitter Feed

When you star/activate a Quick Launch config, a thunderbolt icon appears when hovering over tweets in the [Twitter Tracker](/twitter-tracker).

Click the thunderbolt to instantly deploy that tweet using your starred config's settings—no manual configuration needed. This is perfect for rapid-fire deployments when you spot trending content.

<Note>
Only one Quick Launch config can be starred at a time. The starred config is used for all thunderbolt deployments from your Twitter feed.
</Note>

1. Set up your token information and launch settings
2. Optionally select a Quick Launch config for instant setup
3. Click the **Deploy Token** button
