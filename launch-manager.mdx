The Launch Manager is your command center for managing tokens after they've been deployed. It provides real-time monitoring, coordinated buying and selling across multiple wallets, and automated volume generation.

## Interface Overview

The Launch Manager interface is divided into several key areas:

### Coin Info Panel (Top Left)

The header displays your token's vital statistics:

- **Token Image & Name**: Your token's profile picture, name, and ticker
- **LIVE Badge**: Indicates the token is actively trading
- **Contract Address**: Truncated address with copy button
- **HOLDING**: Current value of your token holdings
- **PNL**: Profit and loss for this token
- **MCAP**: Current market capitalization
- **CURVE**: Bonding curve progress percentage

#### Quick Action Buttons

Below the stats, you'll find quick action buttons:

- **Swap Panel**: Open the trading interface
- **Lock Tokens**: Lock liquidity tokens
- **Pay DEX**: Pay for DEX listing
- **Creator Fees**: Manage creator fee settings

### Tasks Area (Middle Left)

The Tasks section lets you manage automated operations running on your token.

When no tasks are active, you'll see:
- "No active tasks" message
- Tasks appear here when you start volume bots or other automated operations

### Activity Monitor (Bottom Left)

Real-time feed of all trading activity on your token.

Each transaction shows:
- **Type**: BUY (green) or SELL (red)
- **Wallet**: Truncated wallet address
- **YOU Badge**: Highlights your own transactions
- **Time**: When the trade occurred (e.g., "1d ago")
- **Value**: USD value of the trade
- **Amount**: SOL amount traded

Toggle **Hide My Trades** to filter out your own transactions and see only external trading activity.

### Holders Table (Right Side)

The main panel shows all wallets holding your token with powerful bulk management controls.

#### Header Controls

- **Silent Notifications**: Toggle notification sounds
- **Sell Dev**: Quick sell from your developer wallet
- **Sell All**: Sell tokens from all wallets
- **Wallets**: Access wallet management
- **Customize**: Customize the table display

#### Wallet Groups

Your wallet groups appear as expandable sections. Click to expand and see individual wallets.

Each group header shows:
- Group name (e.g., "test")
- Number of wallets (e.g., "20 wallets")
- Total SOL balance
- **Buy In**: Coordinated buying across the group
- **Volume Bot**: Start automated volume generation
- **Sell All**: Sell tokens from all wallets in the group

#### Individual Wallet Rows

Each wallet row displays:
- **WALLET**: Truncated wallet address
- **SOL**: Current SOL balance
- **TOKENS**: Number of tokens held

**Quick Buy Buttons**: Preset SOL amounts for instant buying
- `0.1` | `0.5` | `1` | `2` SOL

**Quick Sell Buttons**: Percentage-based selling
- `25%` | `50%` | `75%` | `100%`

## Buy In Mode

Click the **Buy In** button on any wallet group to access coordinated buying options.

![Buy Mode](/images/launch-manager-buy-mode.png)

Two modes are available:

### Instant Mode

Bundle all selected wallets into a single transaction for simultaneous buying.

**Best for:**
- Maximum speed
- Coordinated entry at the same price point
- Avoiding front-running

### Staggered Mode

Execute buys with custom delays between each wallet.

**Best for:**
- Creating natural-looking buying patterns
- Avoiding detection as coordinated activity
- Spreading buys across time for better average prices

## Instant Buy Modal

When you select Instant mode, this modal appears:

![Instant Buy](/images/launch-manager-instant-buy.png)

### Buy Amounts

Configure how much each wallet will buy:

- **Wallet Selection**: Check/uncheck individual wallets
- **Select All / Deselect All**: Quick selection toggles
- **Amount Field**: Enter SOL amount per wallet
- **MAX Button**: Use wallet's entire balance

### Total Buy Amount

Shows the combined SOL that will be spent across all selected wallets.

Example: "20 wallets will buy in a single bundle"

### Actions

- **Cancel**: Close without executing
- **Instant Buy**: Execute the coordinated purchase

<Note>
Instant buys bundle all transactions together, which is faster but may be more visible on-chain as coordinated activity.
</Note>

## Staggered Buy Modal

When you select Staggered mode, this modal appears:

![Staggered Buy](/images/launch-manager-staggered-buy.png)

### Buy Amounts

Same as Instant mode - select wallets and set individual amounts.

### Timing Mode

Choose how delays are calculated:

#### Delay Range

Set minimum and maximum delays, with random timing between them.

- **Min Delay (ms)**: Minimum wait between buys (e.g., 1000ms = 1 second)
- **Max Delay (ms)**: Maximum wait between buys (e.g., 3000ms = 3 seconds)

The system will pick a random delay within your range for each wallet.

Example display: "Random delay between 1.0s and 3.0s per wallet"

#### Exact Timings

Set specific delays for each individual wallet for precise control.

### Total Buy Amount

Shows combined SOL and execution plan:

Example: "20 wallets will buy sequentially with the configured delays"

### Actions

- **Cancel**: Close without executing
- **Start Staggered Buy**: Begin the sequential buying process

<Note>
Staggered buys take longer to complete but create more natural-looking on-chain activity.
</Note>

## Volume Bot

The Volume Bot automates trading to generate organic-looking activity on your token.

![Volume Bot](/images/launch-manager-volume-bot.png)

### Configuration

#### Wallet Group

Select which wallet group to use for volume generation.

Shows:
- Group name
- Total SOL balance
- Number of wallets

#### Select Wallets

Choose specific wallets within the group to participate.

- **Select All / Deselect All**: Quick toggles
- Individual wallet checkboxes with addresses

#### Buy Delay Range (seconds)

Control the timing between buy transactions:

- **Min**: Minimum seconds between buys
- **Max**: Maximum seconds between buys

Example: Min 1, Max 6 means buys occur randomly between 1-6 seconds apart.

Label: "Time between buy transactions"

#### Buy SOL Amount

Set the SOL range for each purchase:

- **Min**: Minimum SOL per buy
- **Max**: Maximum SOL per buy

Example: Min 0.01, Max 0.05 means each buy uses between 0.01-0.05 SOL.

Label: "SOL amount used per buy (random within range)"

### Options

#### MEV Protection

Toggle: **Use Astralane for transaction protection**

When enabled, transactions are routed through Astralane to protect against MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks like front-running and sandwich attacks.

#### Auto Sell

Toggle: **When disabled, the volume bot will only perform buys**

- **Enabled**: Bot will both buy and sell to create two-way volume
- **Disabled**: Bot only buys, useful for accumulation or price support

### Actions

- **Cancel**: Close without starting
- **Start Volume Bot**: Begin automated volume generation

<Warning>
Volume bots consume SOL from the selected wallets. Ensure wallets have sufficient balance before starting. Monitor your tasks area to track progress and stop if needed.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Managing Live Tokens

- Monitor the Activity feed to understand trading patterns
- Use the Holders table to track wallet distributions
- Keep sufficient SOL in wallets for quick responses

### Coordinated Buying

- Use **Instant mode** when speed is critical
- Use **Staggered mode** for more natural-looking accumulation
- Set realistic delay ranges (1-6 seconds) to appear organic

### Volume Generation

- Start with small amounts to test settings
- Use MEV protection for larger trades
- Monitor the Tasks area to track bot progress
- Adjust delay and amount ranges based on token activity

### Selling

- Use percentage buttons for quick partial sells
- Use **Sell All** only when fully exiting a position
