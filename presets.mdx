Presets let you save frequently-used configurations for quick access. Instead of manually configuring settings every time, create presets once and activate them with a single click.

![Presets Overview](/images/presets-overview.png)

## Types of Presets

CoinWave offers three types of presets:

- **Volume Presets**: Save volume botting configurations for generating trading volume
- **Activity Presets**: Save activity generation settings to make wallets appear established
- **Buy In Presets**: Save coordinated buy-in configurations for token purchases

Each preset type has its own section where you can create, manage, and activate presets.

## Creating Presets

Click the **Create Preset** button at the top right to open the preset type selector.

![Create Preset Dropdown](/images/presets-create-dropdown.png)

Choose which type of preset you want to create:
- **Volume Preset**: For volume botting
- **Activity Preset**: For activity generation
- **Buy In Preset**: For coordinated token buy-ins

### Volume Presets

Save volume botting configurations to generate trading volume on tokens.

Configure the preset:
- **Preset Name**: Name for easy identification
- **Buy SOL Amount Range**: Min and max SOL amount per buy (e.g., 0.01 - 0.05 SOL)
- **Buy Delay Range (seconds)**: Min and max time between buys (e.g., 1 - 6 seconds)
- **MEV Protection**: Enable to protect transactions from MEV bots
- **Auto Sell**: When enabled, automatically sells after buying. When disabled, only performs buys

<Note>
The volume bot will randomize buy amounts and delays within your specified ranges to create natural-looking trading patterns.
</Note>

Click **Create Preset** to save your volume botting configuration.

### Activity Presets

Save activity generation configurations to simulate trading activity on wallets, making them appear established and organic rather than brand new.

![Create Activity Preset](/images/presets-create-activity-full.png)

Configure the preset:
- **Preset Name**: Name for easy identification
- **Buy Percentage Range (%)**: Min and max percentage of wallet balance to use per buy (e.g., 0.5% - 5%)
- **Trade Delay Range (seconds)**: Min and max time between trades (e.g., 10 - 60 seconds)
- **Trades Per Token Range**: Min and max number of times to trade each token (e.g., 5 - 20 trades)
- **Token Count**: Number of different tokens to generate activity across (e.g., 3 tokens)

These settings create randomized, natural-looking trading activity that makes wallets appear active and established.

### Buy In Presets

Save coordinated buy-in configurations for token purchases across multiple wallets.

Configure the preset:
- **Preset Name**: Name for easy identification
- **Buy Mode**: Choose how wallets execute their buys
  - **Instant**: All wallets buy simultaneously
  - **Staggered**: Wallets buy with randomized delays between transactions
- **Buy Amount Range (SOL per wallet)**: Min and max SOL amount each wallet will spend (e.g., 0.05 - 0.15 SOL)

<Note>
Each wallet will get a random buy amount between your min and max values, creating natural-looking buy pressure without obvious patterns.
</Note>

## Managing Presets

### Volume Preset Cards

Each volume preset appears as a card showing its configuration.

- **MEV Protection**: Whether MEV protection is enabled
- **Auto Sell**: Whether automatic selling is enabled
- **Active button**: Click to activate this preset
- **Deactivate button**: Appears when preset is active
- **Delete icon**: Remove this preset

### Activity Preset Cards

Activity generation presets show their trading configurations.

- Preset name
- Active/Inactive status
- **Buy %**: Buy percentage range
- **Trades/Token**: Number of trades per token
- **Tokens**: Number of tokens to trade
- **Active button**: Click to activate
- **Deactivate button**: Appears when active
- **Delete icon**: Remove preset

### Buy In Preset Cards

Buy in presets show their coordinated purchase configurations.

![Group Preset Card](/images/presets-group-card.png)

The card displays:
- Preset name
- Active/Inactive status (green = active)
- **Buy Mode**: Instant or Staggered execution
- **Buy Amount**: SOL amount range per wallet
- **Active button**: Click to activate this preset
- **Deactivate button**: Appears when preset is active
- **Delete icon**: Remove preset

## Using Presets

### Activating Presets

All preset types (Volume, Activity, and Buy In) work the same way:

1. Navigate to the Presets page
2. Find the preset you want to use
3. Click the **Active** button on the preset card
4. The preset is now active and will be applied automatically

Only one preset per type can be active at a time. Activating a new preset automatically deactivates the previous one.

<Note>
Active presets are automatically applied when you use their corresponding features. For example, an active Volume preset will apply its settings when you start volume botting on a token.
</Note>

## Best Practices

- **Name presets clearly**: Use descriptive names like "Quick 0.05 SOL Buy" or "Activity 5-20 trades"
- **Create presets for common strategies**: Save your most-used configurations
- **Match presets to your goals**: Use Volume presets for generating volume, Activity presets for aging wallets, and Buy In presets for coordinated purchases
- **Deactivate when not needed**: Prevent accidental use of the wrong preset
- **Delete unused presets**: Keep your preset list clean and organized
