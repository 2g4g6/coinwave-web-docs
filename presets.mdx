Presets let you save frequently-used configurations for quick access. Instead of manually configuring settings every time, create presets once and activate them with a single click.

![Presets Overview](/images/presets-overview.png)

## Types of Presets

CoinWave offers three types of presets:

- **Deployment Presets**: Save token deployment configurations (dev buy amount, sniper wallets, launch mode)
- **Activity Generation Presets**: Save volume bot settings for consistent trading patterns
- **Group Presets**: Save wallet group configurations for quick group creation

Each preset type has its own section where you can create, manage, and activate presets.

## Creating Presets

Click the **Create Preset** button at the top right to open the preset type selector.

![Create Preset Dropdown](/images/presets-create-dropdown.png)

Choose which type of preset you want to create:
- **Deployment Preset**: For token launches
- **Activity Preset**: For volume generation
- **Group Preset**: For wallet group creation

### Deployment Presets

Save your token deployment settings for consistent launches.

![Create Deployment Preset](/images/presets-create-deployment.png)

Configure the preset:
- **Preset Name**: Name for easy identification
- **Dev Buy (SOL)**: Default developer buy amount
- **Sniper Wallets**: Number of wallets to use for bundled launches (0-3+)
- **Launch Mode**: Choose Standard or Bundled
  - **Standard**: Simple launch with just your master wallet
  - **Bundled**: Launch with multiple wallets for instant distribution

<Note>
Bundled mode supports three execution modes: Safe (block 0), Instant (block 1-2), and Delayed (custom millisecond intervals).
</Note>

Click **Create Preset** to save your configuration.

### Activity Generation Presets

Save volume bot configurations to simulate trading activity on wallets, making them look established and organic rather than brand new.

![Create Activity Preset](/images/presets-create-activity-full.png)

Configure the preset:
- **Preset Name**: Name for easy identification
- **Buy Percentage Range (%)**: Min and max percentage of wallet balance to use per buy (e.g., 0.5% - 5%)
- **Trade Delay Range (seconds)**: Min and max time between trades in seconds (e.g., 10 - 60)
- **Trades Per Token Range**: Min and max number of times to trade each token (e.g., 5 - 20)
- **Token Count**: Number of different tokens to generate activity across (e.g., 3)

These settings create randomized, natural-looking trading activity that makes wallets appear active and established.

### Group Presets

Save wallet group configurations for quick group creation with automatic SOL distribution.

![Create Group Preset](/images/presets-create-group.png)

Configure the preset:
- **Preset Name**: Name for easy identification
- **Wallet Count**: Number of wallets to generate (e.g., 10)
- **Include Dev Wallet**: Mark the first wallet as developer (Yes/No)
- **Group Color**: Choose a color for visual identification
- **Distribution Type**:
  - **Simple**: Distribute equal amounts to all wallets
  - **Advanced**: Distribute with amount range per wallet (randomized distribution)
- **Distribution Amount (SOL)**: Total SOL to distribute to the group

<Note>
When using Advanced distribution, SOL is divided randomly within a range per wallet, making the distribution appear more organic.
</Note>

## Managing Presets

### Deployment Preset Cards

Each deployment preset appears as a card showing its configuration.

![Deployment Preset Card](/images/presets-deployment-card.png)

The card displays:
- Preset name
- Active/Inactive status (green = active)
- **Snipers**: Number of sniper wallets
- **Dev Buy**: Developer buy amount in SOL
- **Mode**: Launch mode (standard/bundled)
- **Active button**: Click to activate this preset
- **Deactivate button**: Appears when preset is active
- **Delete icon**: Remove this preset

### Activity Generation Preset Cards

Volume bot presets show their trading configurations.

![Activity Preset Card](/images/presets-activity-card.png)

The card displays:
- Preset name
- Active/Inactive status
- **Buy %**: Buy percentage range
- **Trades/Token**: Number of trades per token
- **Tokens**: Number of tokens to trade
- **Active button**: Click to activate
- **Deactivate button**: Appears when active
- **Delete icon**: Remove preset

### Group Preset Cards

Wallet group presets show their group configurations.

![Group Preset Card](/images/presets-group-card.png)

The card displays:
- Preset name
- **Wallets**: Number of wallets in the group
- **Dev Wallet**: Whether dev wallet is included (Yes/No)
- **Distribution**: Distribution type (simple/advanced)
- **Amount**: Total SOL distribution amount
- **Delete icon**: Remove preset

<Note>
Group presets don't have an Active/Inactive state. Click the preset to instantly create a new wallet group with these settings.
</Note>

## Using Presets

### Activating Deployment & Activity Presets

1. Navigate to the Presets page
2. Find the preset you want to use
3. Click the **Active** button on the preset card
4. The preset is now active and will be applied automatically

Only one preset per type can be active at a time. Activating a new preset automatically deactivates the previous one.

### Using Group Presets

Group presets work differently - they create new wallet groups instantly:

1. Click anywhere on the group preset card
2. A new wallet group is created with the saved configuration
3. SOL is automatically distributed to all wallets in the group

This makes it easy to quickly set up multiple identical wallet groups for different campaigns.

## Best Practices

- **Name presets clearly**: Use descriptive names like "Quick 0.5 SOL" or "Volume 5-20 trades"
- **Create presets for common strategies**: Save your most-used configurations
- **Use group presets for consistency**: Ensure all your wallet groups have the same setup
- **Deactivate when not needed**: Prevent accidental use of the wrong preset
- **Delete unused presets**: Keep your preset list clean and organized
