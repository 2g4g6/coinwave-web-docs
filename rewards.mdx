- Starting tier for all new users

**Silver** (10 SOL) - Current
- **2.5%** Cashback
- Unlock 5% cashback rate at next tier (Gold)
- Progress tracked with visual indicator

**Gold** (50 SOL)
- **5%** Cashback
- Mid-tier rewards for active traders

**Platinum** (150 SOL)
- **7.5%** Cashback
- Advanced tier for high-volume traders

**Diamond** (500 SOL)
- **10%** Cashback
- Top tier with maximum cashback rewards

<Note>
Cashback is calculated on CoinWave's trading fees. The percentage you earn back increases as you move up tiers, rewarding consistent trading activity.
</Note>

### Claiming Rewards

When you have pending rewards, click the claim button to withdraw them to your master wallet. There are no minimum claim amounts—withdraw whenever you want.

## Affiliate Program

Earn commissions from your referral network across three tiers. When your referrals trade on CoinWave, you earn a percentage of the fees generated.

## 3-Tier Referral System

Earn commissions across three levels of your referral network:

### Level 1: Direct Referrals (30%)

Users who sign up using your referral link.

**Your earnings:** 30% of CoinWave's fee on every trade made by your direct referrals

**Example:**
- Person B signs up with your link and trades 10 SOL in volume
- CoinWave's Fee: 10 SOL × 1% = 0.1 SOL
- Your Commission: 30% of 0.1 SOL = **0.03 SOL**

### Level 2: Indirect Referrals (3%)

Users who sign up using your Level 1 referrals' links.

**Your earnings:** 3% of CoinWave's fee on every trade made by your indirect referrals

**Example:**
- Person B refers Person C, who trades 10 SOL
- CoinWave's Fee: 0.1 SOL
- Your Commission: 3% of 0.1 SOL = **0.003 SOL**
- Person B's Commission: 30% of 0.1 SOL = 0.03 SOL

### Level 3: Extended Referrals (2%)

Users who sign up using your Level 2 referrals' links.

**Your earnings:** 2% of CoinWave's fee on every trade made by your extended referrals

**Example:**
- Person C refers Person D, who trades 10 SOL
- CoinWave's Fee: 0.1 SOL
- Your Commission: 2% of 0.1 SOL = **0.002 SOL**
- Person B's Commission: 3% of 0.1 SOL = 0.003 SOL
- Person C's Commission: 30% of 0.1 SOL = 0.03 SOL

<Note>
Referral commissions are based on CoinWave's net fee (after any user discounts or promotions). The more your network trades, the more passive income you earn.
</Note>
