### Trading Settings

Core trading parameters:

- **WSOL**: Use Wrapped SOL for trading (recommended for faster execution)
- **Unit Limit (CU)**: Compute unit limit for transactions (default: 300000)
- **Unit Price (in microlamports)**: Compute unit price for priority fees (default: 50000)

### Buy/Sell Priority Fees

Set priority fees for buy and sell transactions to increase execution speed:

- **Buy Priority Fee**: Higher fees = faster buy execution
- **Sell Priority Fee**: Higher fees = faster sell execution

<Note>
Priority fees are paid to validators to prioritize your transactions. Higher fees increase the likelihood of your transaction being processed quickly, especially during high network congestion.
</Note>

### Slippage

Control how much price movement you'll accept:

- **Default Slippage %**: Maximum price deviation you'll accept (default: 25%)

Higher slippage allows trades to execute even if the price moves against you, but you may get a worse price. Lower slippage protects against price movement but may cause transaction failures.

### Jito Tips

Configure Jito tip amounts for different actions:

- **Jito Settings**: Customize tip amounts for various transaction types

Jito tips are paid to MEV searchers to bundle your transactions and get better execution. Higher tips generally result in faster and more reliable transaction inclusion.

<Warning>
Jito tips are separate from priority fees. Both help with transaction execution but serve different purposes. Jito tips are for MEV protection and bundling, while priority fees are for validator prioritization.
</Warning>

### Import/Export Settings

Backup and restore your configuration:

- **Import Settings**: Upload a previously exported settings file
- **Export Settings**: Download your current settings as a file
