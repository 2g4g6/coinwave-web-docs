### 4. Save Your Recovery Passphrase

We'll generate a 12-word recovery passphrase for you. This is shown **only once**.

<Warning>
**Critical: This is your ONLY way to recover your wallets**

If you lose access to your account and don't have this passphrase, your funds will be permanently lost. Write it down immediately.
</Warning>

<Note>
Write these words down on paper in order and store them in a secure location. Never share them with anyone.
</Note>

### 5. Start Launching

Once you've confirmed you've saved your recovery passphrase, you're ready to go! Head to your dashboard to start deploying tokens.
