The Twitter Tracker lets you browse your Twitter feed and deploy tokens instantly from any tweet. No copying links, no switching tabs—just click and deploy.

## How It Works

The Twitter Tracker displays your live Twitter feed inside CoinWave. When you see a tweet you want to turn into a token, simply hover over it and click **Deploy**.

The tweet's content automatically populates the deployment form on the left:
- Tweet author's profile picture becomes the token image
- Tweet text becomes the token description
- You can customize everything before deploying

<Note>
This is perfect for launching meme tokens based on trending tweets or viral content.
</Note>

## Feed Controls

At the top of the feed, you'll find several controls:

- **Search tweets**: Filter your feed by keyword
- **Live**: See tweets in real-time as they're posted
- **Vamp Tweet**: Paste any tweet URL to deploy it as a token
- **Smooth Scroll**: Toggle smooth scrolling for easier browsing
- **Filter icon**: Customize which accounts appear in your feed

### Additional Playback Controls

- **Pause on hover**: The feed automatically pauses when you hover over a tweet
- **Pause on spacebar**: Press the spacebar to pause/unpause the feed while browsing
- **Smooth scroll**: Enable smooth scrolling for a more natural viewing experience

## Feed Filter

Customize your feed by filtering which accounts you want to see. Click the filter icon to open the Feed Filter modal.

The filter has two sections:

### CoinWave Handles

Pre-selected accounts curated by CoinWave. These are popular accounts known for posting content worth tokenizing.

- **Select All / Deselect All**: Quickly toggle all CoinWave handles
- **View toggle**: Enable/disable viewing tweets from specific accounts
- **Notify toggle**: Get notifications when these accounts post

### My Handles

Add your own custom accounts to track.

![Add X Account](/images/twitter-tracker-add-account.png)

1. Click the **+** button in the My Handles section
2. Enter the X handle (e.g., `@username`)
3. Click **Add Account**

Your custom handles will appear in the My Handles list with the same view/notify controls.

<Note>
Filtering your feed helps you focus on specific accounts and reduces noise from unrelated content.
</Note>

## Deploying from a Tweet

### Hover to Deploy

When you hover over any tweet, action buttons appear.

**Available actions:**
- **Deploy**: Instantly load this tweet into the deployment form
- **X logo**: View the original post on Twitter/X

### Quick Deployment Process

1. Browse your Twitter feed or search for specific tweets
2. Hover over a tweet you want to tokenize
3. Click the **Deploy** button
4. The deployment form auto-fills with the tweet's content
5. Customize token settings if needed (name, ticker, launch options)
6. Click **Deploy Token** to launch

Everything happens in one interface—no need to leave CoinWave.

## Vamp Tweet

Deploy any tweet by pasting its URL, even if it's not in your feed.

![Vamp Tweet Modal](/images/twitter-tracker-vamp-tweet.png)

1. Click **Vamp Tweet** at the top of the feed
2. Paste the tweet URL (e.g., `https://x.com/username/status/1234567890`)
3. Click **Deploy**

The tweet's content will be fetched and loaded into the deployment form, just like deploying from your feed.

<Note>
Vamp Tweet is perfect for deploying tweets from accounts you don't follow or older tweets that aren't in your current feed.
</Note>

## Best Practices

- **Act fast on trending tweets**: Viral content creates the best opportunities
- **Search for specific topics**: Use the search bar to find niche content
- **Preview before deploying**: Always review the auto-filled information before launching
- **Customize the ticker**: The auto-generated ticker might need adjustment for better branding

## What Happens After Clicking Deploy

When you click Deploy on a tweet:

1. The tweet's media (image/video) is set as the token image
2. The tweet text fills the description field
3. The deployment form on the left is ready to customize
4. You can modify the name, ticker, and all other settings
5. Choose your launch mode (Standard or Bundled)
6. Click **Deploy Token** when ready

Everything from the [Deploying Tokens](/deploying-tokens) page applies—you have full control over all deployment settings.
