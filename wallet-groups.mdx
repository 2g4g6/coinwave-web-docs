Wallet groups are collections of wallets used for bundling tokens and generating trading volume. Each group can contain up to 20 wallets, all managed together for efficient operations.

## Wallet Group Cards

Each wallet group appears as a card on your dashboard, showing key information at a glance.

The card displays:
- **Group Name** and number of wallets
- **Total Balance** across all wallets in the group
- Quick action buttons:
  - **Distribute**: Send SOL to all wallets in the group
  - **Activity**: Generate human-like trading activity (volume)
  - **Export**: Download wallet data as a file

## Distributing SOL

Before your wallets can trade, they need SOL. The distribute function makes this easy.

![Distribute SOL](/images/wallet-group-distribute.png)

1. Click the **Distribute** button on your wallet group card
2. Enter the **Total Amount (SOL)** you want to distribute
3. Optional: Enable **Advanced Transfer** to set min/max amounts per wallet
4. Optional: Enable **Use Mixer** to break bubblemap connections (1% fee for one day)
5. Click **Distribute**

The SOL will be automatically divided and sent to all wallets in the group.

<Note>
Using the mixer helps create clean wallets by breaking on-chain connections visible on bubblemaps and other blockchain explorers.
</Note>

## Generate Human Activity

Make your token look organic with automated trading that mimics real users.

![Generate Activity](/images/wallet-group-activity-generator.png)

Configure your volume bot with these settings:

- **Min Balance % / Max Balance %**: Percentage of wallet balance used per buy (e.g., 10%-30%)
- **Min Trade Delay (s) / Max Trade Delay (s)**: Time between trades in seconds (e.g., 5-15 seconds)
- **Min Trades/Token / Max Trades/Token**: How many times each wallet trades (buy and sell count as 1 trade each)
- **Number of Tokens**: How many different tokens to generate activity across

1. Click the **Activity** button on your wallet group
2. Configure the randomization settings
3. Click **Generate Activity**

The bot will automatically execute natural-looking trades across your wallets with randomized timing and amounts.

<Warning>
Make sure your wallets have sufficient SOL balance before generating activity. The bot needs funds to execute trades.
</Warning>

## Groups Sidebar

Access advanced group management through the Groups sidebar.

Available actions:
- **Distribute**: Send SOL to all wallets
- **Gen. Activity**: Generate trading volume
- **Return SOL**: Send all SOL back to your master wallet
- **Sell SPL**: Sell all SPL tokens held by wallets
- **Close Accounts**: Close empty token accounts to reclaim rent
- **Export Wallets**: Download wallet data as a file
- **Delete Group**: Permanently remove this wallet group

<Warning>
Deleting a group only removes it from CoinWave. Your wallets and funds remain on-chain. Make sure to export your private keys before deleting if you need them later.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

- **Keep groups organized**: Use descriptive names and colors for easy identification
- **Distribute SOL evenly**: Make sure all wallets have enough balance for trading
- **Use realistic activity settings**: Avoid obvious patterns by using randomized delays and amounts
- **Export regularly**: Back up your wallet data periodically
- **Use the mixer for privacy**: Break on-chain connections when bundling tokens
